#Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries for data handling, machine learning, and GUI.
#GUI Setup: Create a Tkinter GUI with options to load a CSV file, enter prediction days, and show results.
#Load File: Load the selected CSV file and prepare the data for prediction.
#Prepare Data: Convert dates to ordinal format, split data into training and testing sets, and train a linear regression model.
#Predict: Use the trained model to predict future stock prices based on user input.
#Plot: Plot historical and predicted stock prices using matplotlib.
#Running the Program:
#Save the code to a file, e.g., stock_predictor.py.
#Run the program: python stock_predictor.py.
#Use the GUI to load a CSV file with historical stock prices, enter the number of days to predict, and see the predictions.
